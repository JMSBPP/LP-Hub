We have reserves USDC 40000, WETH 10
The entry price p0 = 4000.

Consider a Liquidity provider who wnats to provide 1 WETH worth of liquidity in the price range [1500, 4500]. The lower and upper ticks are 73236 and 84223 respectively.

We have that $L = 1106.35$ Where is this value coming from ?

Now consider a pool with price $P_{Y/X} = 2$ \\
How much liquidity do I provide for a tolerance $\pm 0.2 \implies [1.8,2.2]$
